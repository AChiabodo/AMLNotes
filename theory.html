<p>What is AI ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Thinking humanly : cognitive science, the idea is that the computer can think like a human.</li>
<li>Acting Humanly : be able to pass the Turing test, but with nowadays technology it is easy, but a more appropriate test (winograd schema) can be more difficult for AI.Winograd schema: Multiple choice questions that can be easily answered by people but cannot be answered by computers using “cheap tricks”.</li>
<li>Thinking rationally : 'right' way of thinking the idea is that the machine must follow the 'logic', but problem of uncertainty, and in the fact that real-word problems are not always well defined.</li>
<li>Acting rationally : achieve the best outcome even considering the uncertainty, trying to provide the utility optimality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Definition of <em>Learning</em> :</p>
<ol>
<li>extract information from the experience (data)</li>
<li>perform a task</li>
<li>measure the performance of the task.</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to get a computer do well on a task, without explicitly programming it.</p>
<p><strong>Programming Approach</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/programming_path.png" alt="Programming approach"></p>
<p>The main problem of the 'traditional approach' is that a full tolerant system is very difficult to build and (especially) to maintain.</p>
<p><strong>ML Approach</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/machine_learning_path.png" alt="ML approach"></p>
<p><em>Supervised Learning</em>
With the data x is provided also the output y (ground truth) and the goal is to learn a function that maps the input to the output. X can be multi-dimensional, each dimension correspond to an attribute.</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification : if y is discrete, for example a label.</li>
<li>Regression : if y is continuous, for example a real number.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unsupervised Learning</em> <br>
Given the data x_1, x_2, ..., x_n without any label, the goal is to find a structure in the data, for example a clustering.</p>
<p><em>Reinforcement Learning</em>
The agent interacts with the environment, and the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the reward.A sort of trial and error approach to reach the goal, it is not important the fail but only the final result.</p>
<p>But how to manage a learning problem? A Machine Learner MUST be aple to apply a pseudo-algorithm :</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the domain, find a right prior knowledge and define the goal.</li>
<li>All the process related to the data : integration, selection, cleaning, transformation, pre-processing and so on.</li>
<li>Learn models</li>
<li>Interpret the results</li>
<li>Consolidate and deploy the discovered knowledge</li>
<li>Go back to 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember the phrase 'garbage in, garbage out', that underline the importance of the data.</p>
<p><strong>How to deal with data?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Observe the data : analyse details, find patterns, error, outliers, and so on. Different distribution of data can have the same mean and variance, but one can be linearly separable and the other not.</li>
<li>Summarize the 'uncertainty', search for constraints and invariances (prior knowledge) and find a model : to find the model to map the input x into the output y it is important the prior knowledge. <br>
<img src="images/model_prior_knowledge.png" alt=""> <br>
In this case we can map the problem using a degree 3 polynomial (y = a x^3 + b x^2 + cx + d), but if we have the prior knowledge the data come from a periodic source, it is possible to use a trigonometric function (y = a sin(x) + b x + c). But also the same data can be described using a function, a parametric curve, polar coordinates...</li>
<li>Represent the data : how many dimension to rappresent the problem? it is useful to use a dimensionality reduction technique? This problems MUST be considered before to start the learning process.</li>
<li>Find a solution to learn both the representation and the data (using advanced computing capabilities): deep learning can be, also, a task-driven (depend on the task, e.g. in poker and in 'briscola' the importance of the features of the cards is different) paradigm to extract patterns. <br>
Deep learning is a task-driven paradigm to extract patterns and latent features from given observations.</li>
<li>Avoid data bias : the AI learn what humas teaches, it is needed an 'adaptation' to avoid bias. The 'adaptation' consists in various techniques, for example Resampling (oversample/undersample to balance the classes), weighted loss function (different weights for different classes) , data augmentation (add noise, variate the existing data)...</li>
</ol>

<p>Probability &lt;-&gt; ML is all about making predictions <br>
The probability has the ability to summarize the uncertainty</p>
<ul>
<li>Uncertain input (missing data, noise..)</li>
<li>Uncertain knowledge (prior knowledge, multiple causes can lead to the same effect...)</li>
<li>Uncertain output (incomplete deductive inference may be uncertain)</li>
</ul>
<p>A sample space Ω is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment (can be finite or not), an event is a subset of the sample space. <br>
The probability of an event A is a function that map the event to a real number in the interval [0,1] , 0&lt;= P(A) &lt;= 1. \</p>
<ul>
<li>$P(empty) = 0 , P(Ω) = 1$</li>
<li>$P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)$</li>
</ul>
<p>A random variable (R.V.) is a function of the outcome of a randomized experiment(given 2 dice the r.v. X is their sum).</p>
<p>Joint distribution : P(X,Y) if two (or more) r.v. interact to each other. <br>
The probability of an Event E is the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes in E. $P(E) = \sum P(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ <br>
Marginal distribution : $P(X) = \sum P(X,Y)$ over Y, that means the elimination of variables. <br>
Conditional Probability : $P(X|Y) = P(X,Y)/P(Y)$ -&gt; fraction of worlds where X is true given Y true. Where P(Y) is the probability of the event Y occurring \</p>
<p>Probabilistic Inference : compute the desired probability from other known probabilities. <br>
The product and the chain rule : $P(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) = P(x_1)P(x_2|x_1)P(x_3|x_1,x_2)...P(x_n|x_1,x_2,...,x_n-1)$  , using only two terms $P(X,Y) = P(X)P(Y|X)$ . From this formula it is possible to derive the Bayes rule :</p>
<p>$P(X|Y) = \frac{P(Y|X)}{P(Y)}  * P(X)$</p>
<p>Built one conditional probability from the reverse.<br>
This formula is the most important AI equation, give us the possibility to built one conditional probability from the reverse. Let's reason using the keywords hypotesis and evidence. <br>
$ P(hypothesis| evidence) = P (evidence | hypothesis) * P (hypothesis) / P (evidence) $</p>
<p>For our goal it is possible to ignore the denominator, because it is a normalization factor, P(hypothesis) is the <strong>prior probability</strong>, P(evidence | hypothesis) is the <strong>likelihood</strong> and P(hypothesis | evidence) is the <strong>posterior probability</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/likelihood.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Independence : two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. $P(X,Y) = P(X)P(Y) and P(X|Y) = P(X)$<br>
Naive Bayes assumption : each feature is independent from the others, so the joint probability is the product of the single probabilities. This mechanism is used in the Naive Bayes classifier and decrease significantly the computational complexity, the likelihood function became very easy to calculate and the classification (assign the label) is only a matter of finding the maximum of the posterior probability.
A naive bayes classifier is very simple but can provide good results, it is used in specific domain, if the assumption of independence can be considered valid and if the training data are not too small, with a large number of features.</p>
<p>It is possible to use the Laplace Smoothing to avoid the zero probability problem, that can cause a problem in the classification.</p>
<p>$P(X=v | Y=y) = (count(X=v,Y=y) + k) / (count(Y=y) + k|X|)$ where |X| is the number of values that X can assume and k is the strength of the prior. \
<strong>Generative Learning</strong> : learn the joint probability P(X,Y). Generative models aim to capture the joint distribution of both input and output, this approach include models like GMM and others. For example, models that predict the next word in a sequence are typically generative models<br>
<strong>Discriminative Learning</strong>: learn the posterior probability P(Y|X) directly from the data.Concerned with modeling conditional probabilities, specifically the probability of the output given the input, this approach include models like logistic regression, SVM, NN for classification and others.  A discriminative model ignores the question of whether a given instance is likely, and just tells you how likely a label is to apply to the instance</p>
<p><strong>Maximum a Posteriori (MAP)</strong>  seeks to find the parameter values that maximize the posterior probability of the parameter, taking into account both prior knowledge and observed data.When conditional independence is satisfied, Naive Bayes corresponds to MAP classification.</p>
<p>$ MAP=argmax_θ ​P(θ∣D)$</p>
<p>This is based on the consideration of i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) hypothesis.<br>
The MAP is maximized by the same hypothesis that maximizes the likelihood function, considering a unfiorm prior, that is used to penalize complexity (more complex hypothesis have lower prior probability).</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)</strong>: Suppose we want to estimate an unobserved population parameter based on observations. MLE maximizes the likelihood of our observed data given the parameter. It’s a common method for point estimation
<img src="images/MLE.png" alt="Maximum likelihood estimator"></p>
<p>For large amount of data it is possible to appoximate the MAP with the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE).</p>
<p>Continuous Random Variables : if its set of possible values is an entire interval of numbers, the probability of a single point is zero $P(X=x_1)=0$ , the probability of an interval is $$P (x_1&lt;=X&lt;=x_2) = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x) , dx$$</p>
<p>Moments : are a set of quantities useful to describe the distribution od a r.v. or a dataset.</p>
<ul>
<li>$1^{st}$ moment <strong>Expectation</strong><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox0" checked="true"><label for="checkbox0">= \mu = \sum_{x} x P(x)$ for a discrete r.v. and $= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) , dx$  for a continuous one.</label></li>
<li>$2^{nd}$ moment <strong>Variance</strong><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox1" checked="true"><label for="checkbox1">= $ $\sigma^{2} $ $= E [(x - E[X])^{2}]  = \sum_{x} (x-E[X])^{2}f(x)$ for a discrete r.v. and $= E [(X - E[X])^{2}]  = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x-E[X])^{2}f(x) , dx$ for a continuous one.</label></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The MLE for a Gaussinan distribution</em></p>
<p>After some calculations it is possible to find that the MLE for the mean is $ \mu_{MLE} = 1/n * \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ and the variance $ \sigma^{2}<em>{MLE} = 1/n *  \sum</em>{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2 $</p>
<p><strong>How good is the estimator</strong> <br>
An estimator is a rule or a formula that helps us to estimate the value of an unknown parameter in a population using sample data.<br>
There are two main properties for the evaluation of an estimator :</p>
<ul>
<li>Bias : how close is the etimate to the real value, $Bias(\hat{\theta}) = E[\hat{\theta}] - \theta$ , if the bias is zero the estimator is unbiased.</li>
<li>Variance : how we expect the estimator to vary as function of data samples, between two unbiased estimators the one with the lower variance is better.The square root of the variance is called standard error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mean Squared Error : let $\hat{\theta}$ be an estimator for an unknown parameter $\theta$, $MSE(\hat{\theta}) = E[(\hat{\theta} - \theta)^2] $. This is the standard formula but it is also possible to use the variance and the bias to compute the MSE, $MSE(\hat{\theta}) = Var(\hat{\theta}) + Bias(\hat{\theta})^2$ .</p>
<p>Here a table with some distributions and their properties :</p>
<p><img src="images/table_distribution.png" alt="Distributions"></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="lezione-3">Lezione 3</h3>
<hr>
<p>3 main questions :</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we minimize the training error while we are interested in the test error?</li>
<li>it is possible to obtain 100% accuracy?</li>
<li>What are the important parameters characterizing the learning process?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's define X the input space and Y the output space,composed by K possible classes/categories, (x,y) is a labeled sample, with x the measurement of the object and y the category the object belongs; <br>
D is the distribution over the space of labeled example, but it is unknown, but represent the population we care about. f() is the function that produce the label, Y = f(X), we can define the <em>LOSS</em> of a classifier as the function that measure the error between the assigned label and the real one (we call it h(x)), $L(h(x),f(x)) = L(h(x),y)$.</p>
<p>The <em>true risk</em> is the probability that the classifier does not predict the correct label on a random drawn point from D, $R_D(h) = P[h(x) != Y]$ in other words it is the expected value of the loss $E_{x-D} {L(h(x), Y)}$</p>
<p><strong>Bayes Risk</strong> is the minimum risk that can be achieved, regardless of what classifier is used, it represents the lowest possible prediction error that can be achieved. <br>
$R^* (h*) = min_h R_D(h)$. <br>
It is used to evaluate how well a specific decision rule performs by taking into account both the prior probabilities and the loss associated with different outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>IDD condition</strong> : the key assumption of previous and future definitions is that the data are independent and identically distributed.</p>
<p><strong>Empirical risk</strong> evaluates the quality of model's prediction $$R_S(h) = 1/n \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1(h(x_i),y_i)$$ However it is impossible to have a perfect classifier, with $R_S(h)=0$ even if the Bayes risk = 0, so we'b be happy if $R_S(h)&lt;= \epsilon $ (accuracy parameters), but again it is difficult to guarantee this condiction for sure, so we can allow a fail probability $\delta \in (0,1)$ (confidence parameter).<br>
The learner should output an hypothesis h such that $ P[R_D(h)&lt;= \epsilon] &gt;= 1 - \delta$ --&gt; <strong>PAC (Probably Approximately Correct)</strong> learning.</p>
<p>Realizability assumption : for a given class H of function X -&gt; {0,1} there exist $ h* \in H$ such that $R_D(h*) = 0$. This means the family of function holds in the Bayes model.</p>
<p><img src="images/Pac_learning.png" alt="PAC"></p>
<p>$m_H$ is the sample complecity of learning H, that refers to the minimum number of training examples or data points required to effectively learn a target concept or function. It helps determine how much data is needed to train a machine learning model that can make accurate predictions or inferences.</p>
<p>The famous rule of taking a number of sample at least 10 times the number of parameters come from the discretization trick, that is used to convert a continuous problem into a discrete one. Each parameters have 32 bits and so $2^{32}$ possible values, so even an Infinite Hypothesis classes Problem is managed as a finite one and with d parameters, $| H_{discrete}| &lt;= 2^{32d}$ and using the logarithm $ln | H_{discrete}| &lt;= 10d$.</p>
<p>Underfitting and Overfitting :</p>
<ul>
<li>Underfitting : when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the training data. As a result, it performs poorly not only on the training data but also on new, unseen data. Typically has high bias and low variance, it fails to fit the training data and, as a result, misses important relationships between the features and the target variable.</li>
<li>Overfitting : when a machine learning model is too complex or flexible and fits the training data too closely, including the noise and random fluctuations. While it may perform very well on the training data, it does not generalize well to new, unseen data.Typically has low bias and high variance,it captures noise in the training data, leading to a model that performs poorly when applied to data it has not seen before. Usually exhibits irregular and complex decision boundaries.<br>
To avoid overfitting is possible to use regularization, that is a technique that penalize complex model.
$$ h_s = argmin (1/m * \sum_{i=1}^{m} 1[h(x_i) != y_i] + \lambda * Complexity(h))$$
the $\lambda$ value is an parameter that can be find using the cross validation technique, it is a positive number to scale the complexity value with the loss (it is possible that the two values are in different scales).
<img src="images/UnderOverfit.png" width="700px" height="250px"></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="4"><strong>K - fold Cross Validation</strong> </font> : the basic idea is to devide the dataset into k subsets, called folds, and use one fold as validation set and the others as training set. This process is repeted k times, so each fold is used as validation set once. The performances of the model are evaluated at each steps and the average is used as final result, to evaluate how well the model is able to generalize.

with sigma the sigmoid function $\sigma(x) = \frac {1}{ 1 + e^{-x}}$, but the problem of this loss is that it is not convex, so it is not possible to find the global optima.
The loss function can be rewritten as
$$ l({x_i,y_i}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} -y_i * (log(\sigma (ax_i+b))) - (1-y_i) (log(1 -\sigma (ax_i+b)))$$
This loss function is convex, so there is a global optima.<br>
To find the optimal, apply the gradient over the two variable {a,b}, and set the entire expression to zero (this is a common technique to find the global putting the derivative to zero) after some math passages we find arrive at
$ y_i \nabla_{\theta} ln( \sigma(ax_i + b)) + (1-y_i) \nabla_{\theta} ln(1- \sigma(ax_i + b)) $ taking the first function the process is to derivate a function of a function of a function and so on... as we can see the problem is NOT LINEAR and to find the optimal value it is necessary a lot of computation.

<p>The gradient of a function is orthogonal to the level curves/surfaces of the function, useful to find the direction to follow.

<p>$\alpha$ is called <strong>Learning Rate</strong>, an it is an hyperparameters that influence the step size, so the speed of convergence and the risk of overshooting. The step size is not given only by  $\alpha$  but by  $\alpha ||\nabla f||$ , with  $\alpha$ &gt; 0. Usually the value of the learning rate is 0.0001&lt;=x&lt;=0.1 , smaller values are used for more complex problems and larger dataset (e.g. 0.001 or lower) meanwhile larger values are suitable for simple problems (e.g. 0.1) <br>
The goal is to find a  $\alpha$  that allow to get the lowest point of the funtion where the gradient is tangent to the isocurve, but there is another hyperparameters that influence the convergence, the initialization point.</p>
<img src="images/learning_rate.png"  width="600px" height="250px">
<p>$\alpha$ can be a constant value (not so effective) or adaptive, changing the value according to another parameter $\rho$ <br>
decay parameter : $\alpha^{(t+1)} = \frac{\alpha^{(t)}}{1+ \rho*t} $ .... many different implementations are possible. <br>
A Momentum is a technique helps to improve the convergence speed and to escape from the local minima, the idea is to accumale 'gradient' at each step (like an accellerator) <br>
momentum → $v^{(t+1)}= \lambda v^{(t)} + \alpha \nabla f(x^{(t)})$ and $ x^{(t+1)} = x^{(t)} +v^{(t+1)}$. Usually the value of the momentum is from 0.0 to 1.0, the higher the value the more the gradient is accumulated, with 1.0 the update is only based on the past gradients and  with 0.0 the update is only based on the current gradient.
The main idea is to maintain a moving average of the past gradients and use it to adjust the current gradient update, the effect is to smooth the updated trajectory and reduce the oscillations.</p>
<p>Usually we are not interested in the global optimum, because it can cause overfitting (on the training data), but the goal is to be able to generalize well; this approach can be used both for convex and non-convex problems. Instead in DL usually we can have non-convex and non-differentiable problems, so the gradient descendent can't be used.<br>
To compute the loss it is necessary to compute the gradient for each sample in the summation term, indeed two bottlenecks that make GD not always applicable are, the number of parameters and the number of samples.</p>

<p>The idea is to take a mini-batch $\beta \in \Tau$ that is the whole dataset,with m &lt;&lt; n examples and calculate the derviatives over this subset. The mini-batch must have rappresentative/meaningful data to approximate well the gradient.

<p><font size="3"><strong>Excursus on perceptron</strong></font></p>
<p>The idea came from the human neuron, the basic unit of the brain.
A perceptron is a single unit (single component of a neural network) that take as input the values of the features, multiply them by the weights (each feature has an own weight) and sum them up(that is the activation function), at the end it is also possible to apply another function (e.g. step function).</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/single_perceptron.png"  width="300px" height="150px">
</div>
<p>Used as linear classifier, the weights are inizialized to zero, a classification is performed and the weights are updated according to the result (error or correctly classified) $w_i = w_i + y^* x $. If the prediction is wrong $y^* x$ is negative otherwise positive.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/adjusting_weights.png"  width="auto" height="200px">
</div>
<p>This is the best algorithm but only if the data are LINEARLY SEPARABLE, otherwise the alg will loop forever or it is possible to set a maximum number of iterations or a threshold to stop the process even for non-separable dataset, but this can lead to bad separating solutions.</p>
<p>Idea !! only one perceptron can't solve problems where data are not linearly separable, but this problem can be solved using multiple perceptrons.</p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Neural Network</strong></font></p>
<p>Advanced models -&gt; we are interesting in non-linear function because many interesting phenomena are non-linear, trying to create a model with a good universality, that means the model is able to approximate any function, fixing the general form of the parametric model and optimizing the parameters, with a bonus objective that is use a model that is not too complex to use.</p>
<p>Using a multi-layer perceptron approach the general schema is :
$$  output ⬅ (\sigma \quad o\quad f_{\Theta_{n}})o(\sigma \quad o \quad f_{\Theta_{n-1}})o..o(\sigma \quad o \quad f_{\Theta_{1}})(x)⬅ input $$
Each $f$ function has its own parameters/weights $\Theta$ that come from the previous layer. We can call hidden layer the rappresentation after the linear function and before the activation function, $ x_{l+1} = \sigma (W_{l}x_{l} + b_l )$ where each row of the matrix W is called Neuron.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/hidden_layer.png"  width="auto" height="200px">
</div>
<p>The last layer or output layer determines the co-domain of the network, for example using a sigmoid the network will be map to $R^p → (0,1)^q$ but for generality, usually it is used a linear layer as output to map the result as $R^p → R^q$</p>
<p><strong>Universality Approximation Theorem</strong>: this theorem demonstrate that a neural network with a single hidden layer, with a sufficient number of neurons, can approximate any continuous function with an arbitrary accuracy, working on a compact subset of the input space.
But it doesn't say how to compute the weights to reach the accuracy, or how many neurons, but empirical results show that with a sufficient #neurons + gradient descent we can have good results.</p>
<p>Solving the  weights $\Theta$ is called &quot;Training&quot;. Let's use the MSE (mean squared error) as loss function $ \nabla(l_\Theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \nabla_{\Theta}||y_i - g_{\theta}(x_i) ||^{2}<em>{2} $ with $g</em>{\theta}(x_i) =  (\sigma (f_{\theta_n} (\sigma (f_{\theta_n}....(x)))))$, computing the gradient is the bottle neck of this approach so we need an automatization of this computational step.</p>
<p><strong>Computational Graph</strong> :<br>
A possible approach is creating the computational graph, that represent a mathematical expression as an acyclic graph, where nodes are the operations and the edges are the data dependencies. The evaluation of $f(x)$ correspond to a forward traversal of the graph.</p>
<p>Here some possible examples, the last one is a graph with more than one dimension:</p>

<img src="images/cg3.png"  width="auto" height="200px">
<p><strong>Automatic Differentiation</strong><br>
the basic idea is to systematically compute the derivatives of a function by breaking it down into elementary operations and evaluating their derivatives at a particular point; in this way the cost of computing the derivative is equal to compute the function itself. <br>
Using the <strong>'Forward Mode'</strong> the computational graph is traversed from the input to the output, in this way the cost of computing the derivative is equal to compute the function itself, but instead if the input is high dimensional, the cost of the gradient = #dimension * cost of computing the function. The partial derivate are computed ,using the chain rule, respect to the input (using x as input we calculate $ \frac{d}{dx}y,\frac{d}{dx}z... $). This approach is very efficient if the function has a single input and many outputs. <br>
Using the <strong>'Reverse Mode'</strong> the computational graph is traversed from the output to the input,it is very efficient if the function has many input and a single output, the first derivate is the output respect to the output and so on.</p>
<p>Both methods provide the same results, but the area of application is different.</p>
<p>The first example is the application of the forward mode, the second one is the application of the reverse mode.</p>
  <img src="images/ad_forwardmode.png" width="auto" height="200px">
  <img src="images/ad_reversemode.png" width="auto" height="200px">
<p>We can call <strong>back-propagation</strong>, the reverse mode AD applied to a neural network, evaluate $\nabla l$ with backprop is faster than evaluate $l$.<br>
<strong>Important</strong> : backprop (but also the forward mode) is not just the chain rule, there are intermediate variables.</p>

<p>A neural network is a complex structure composed by multiple layers, each layer is a function that try to rappresent the reality, usually a layer is a non-linear function of a linear function and the parameters of a layer are the weights (including the bias terms). Each node is connected to all the nodes of the previous layer, and the output of a node is (a part of) the input of all the nodes of the next layer</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear layer = $g^{(k)} = \lambda(W^{(k)}* g^{(k-1)} )$</li>
<li>Activation function, is a non-linear function, typically the ReLU function, $\lambda(x) = max(x,0)$</li>
<li>Parameters, $W^{(1)}, W^{(2)} ... $ are matrix of weights, for the corresponding layer, they include also the bias terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>This type of structure is called <em>Feed Forward Neural Network</em>, it is universal but it has some problems, as the fact it can be arbitrarily complex, difficult to optimize and the number of parameters can be too high to be handled, additionally it is very difficult to achieve generalization.</p>
<p>There are problems, to partially solve them we can use a <em>prior knowledge</em> task-indipendent, this must be derived from the data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Structure as prior : usually data brings a defined structure, repeating patterns, locality...</li>
<li>self-similarity: properties of the data can be remain the same in different domain (e.g. images, a chair has always the same characteristics)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important characteristic is the <em>traslation invariance</em>, the output of the model must not change if the input is translated, using the example of an image, an element remain the same even if it is moved in the image.</p>
<p><font size="5"><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</strong></font></p>
<p>In this structure the output of a node depend only on specific input (and not all the output of the previous layer), indeed the layers are not fully connected anymore. This architecture is useful to reduce the number of parameters and the computational cost, trying to capture the patterns in the data (hierarchical, local, traslation invariance....).</p>

<p>Teoretical explanation : <em>Convolution</em><br>
The convolution is a math operation that combine 2 functions to produce a third one. Given two functions G and F : $ [-\pi , \pi]$ the convolution function is :</p>
<p>$$   (f \star g) (x) =\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t) g(x-t) $$</p>
<img src="images/step_convolution.png" width="auto" height="200px">
<img src="images/step_ramp_conv.png" width="auto" height="200px">
<p>This operation is commutative and shift equivariant (is not the opposite of invariant), that means $ G(T f) = T (G f) $. <br>
$(f \star g) (x)$ is the <em>feature map</em>, provide a hierarchical representation of the input data, low-level feature maps capture simple patterns instead high-level fm capture more complex structures.<br>
$g(x-t) $ is the <em>kernel</em> (or Convolutional Filter), it is a smaller size grid of weights used to perform the convolutional op with the input data.</p>
<p>Usually we care about the discrete convolution, the only difference is the integral is replaced by a sum. This approach is useful especially for the images, where the input is a matrix of pixels.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="images/cnn_pooling.png"  width="auto" height="200px">
</div>
<p>The main idea is to compose equivariant layers implemented via convolutio, in this new structure the number of connection is decreased and has been added a new operation, the pooling, a sort of downsampling that reduce the amount of parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Convolutional layer : $ g^{(k)}(x) = \sigma ( \sum_{i=1}^{M} (g^{(k-1)} \star w^{k})(x))$</li>
<li>Activation function : $\sigma(x) = max(x,0)$, ReLU (one of the possibilities)</li>
<li>Parameters : the filters $w^{(k)}$ (the weights)</li>
<li>Polling layer : $ g^{(k)}(x) || g^{(k-1)}(x') : x' \in N(x)||_n $</li>
</ul>
<p>Here an example of polling applied to an image, with this 3x3 filter the output is a 3x3 matrix. In this example this allow to capture non-local interaction. This layer has no learning params but only hyperparams, like the size of the filter, the stride, the padding and the number of filters; it makes the representation smaller and more manageable and it operates over each activation map indipendently.</p>
<img src="images/polling_layer.png"  width="auto" height="200px">
<p>From now we'll consider example with images as input.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fully connected layer : taking as input an image 32x32x3, is transformed into a 1x3072 vector, this approach doesn't take into account the spatial structure of the image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convolutional layer : taking as input an image 32x32x3, applying a 5x5x3 filter/kernel (important that the depth is the same), the feature map is a 28x28x1 image, applying more than one filter is possible to obtain more than one activation map, stacking up the N future maps obtain an 'image' 28x28xN, where N is the number of filters.<br>
How to calculate the dimension of the output? The output size is = <strong>(N - F + 2*P /stride) + 1</strong>, with N dimension of the input, F dimension of the filter, P the padding size and stride the step size, for example a matrix 7x7 with a filter 3x3 and stride 1, the output is 5x5. Note that the dimension of the outut MUST be an integer so not all the stride are possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Input a volume of size W1xH1xD1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 hyperparameters required: K (number of filters), F (spatial extent), S (stride), P (zero-padding)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produces a volume of size W2xH2xD2 where:</p>
<ul>
<li>W2 = ((W1 - F + 2P)/S) + 1</li>
<li>H2 = ((H1 - F + 2P)/S) + 1 (i.e. width and height are computed equally by symmetry)</li>
<li>D2 = K</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>With parameter sharing, it introduces F x F x D1 weights per filter, for a total of (F * F * D1)*K weights and K biases. For example if the input volume has size 32x32x3 and the 10 filters have size 5x5, with stride 1 and 2 padding the number of parameters 5x5x3 +1 = 76, so the total number of parameters is 76x10 = 760.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total number of multiply-adds is equal to the number of output values (W2xH2xD2) multiplicated by the number of weights in each filter (F<em>F</em>D1). E.g. if the input volume has size 32x32x3, the output volume has size 32x32x10, and the filter size is 5x5x3, then the number of multiply-adds is 32x32x10 = 10240  and the numeber of weights per filter is 5x5x3 = 75, so the total number of multiply-adds is 10240x75 = 768k.</p>

<p>The <strong>Batch Normalization</strong>  is a technique that normalize the output of a layer, to have zero mean and unit variance, it reduce the 'internal covariate shift' (the change in the distribution of internal activations due to the change in network parameters during training), improve optimization and other benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Normalized term : $ \hat{x}^{(k)} = \frac{x^{(k)} - \mu^{(k)}}{\sqrt{\sigma^{(k)^2} + \epsilon}}$ with $\epsilon$ a small constant to avoid division by zero</li>
<li>Dynamic learnt terms : $ \gamma^{(k)} = \sqrt{ VAR [x^{(k)}]}$ called scalar factor and $ \beta^{(k)} = E[x^{(k)}]$ called shift, these parameters are useful to give to the model more flexibility, indeed applying a static normalization withouth these parameters can reduce the capacity of the model.</li>
<li>Normalized output : $ y^{(k)} = \gamma^{(k)} \hat{x}^{(k)} + \beta^{(k)}$</li>
</ul>
<p>Some possible benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the gradient flow through the network</li>
<li>Allow using higher learning rates (that means bigger steps and faster convergence)</li>
<li>Reduce the strong dependence on initialization (the network is less sensitive to the initialization weights)</li>
<li>Improve the gradient flow through the network (the gradient is not affected by the scale of the parameters or the activation functions)</li>
<li>Deeper networks easier to train (the normalization reduces the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients)</li>
<li>Acts as a regularizer (the regularization helps to reduce the risk of overfitting)</li>
</ul>

<p>Problems :</p>
<ul>
<li>Not well understood why it works (theoretically)</li>
<li>Source of bugs because his behavior is different between training and testing. During training, the normalization helps in reducing the internal covariate shift, thereby making the network easier to train (mean and variance of the current minibatch). During testing, using the population statistics helps in making the predictions more stable and independent of the specific mini-batches seen during training (mean and variance of the entire population).</li>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font> <br>
use the simple ReLu, the other versions increase the accuracy but not so much, but the main thing is not to use the sigmoid or tanh.</p>
<p><strong>Data PreProcessing</strong> : Usually can be useful to preprocess the data, there are many techniques, it is possible to center the data (subtract the mean) or normalize the data (divide by the standard deviation), this process can lead to a better convergence and to a better generalization.<br>
It is also possible to use the PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data, or Whitening of the data, that is a transformation that makes the data less correlated, so the features are more indipendent. Whitening is often used in image preprocessing, where it helps in removing redundancy by making adjacent pixels less correlated.</p>
<p><strong>Vanishing Gradient</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters become very small during backpropagation. This problem can make learning very slow/difficult for the lower layers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exploding Gradient</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters become very large during backpropagation. This problem can lead to large updates to the weights (model parameters) causing the model to diverge.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><font size="5"><strong>Weight Initialization</strong></font>
If the weights are initialized to zero, all output are 0 and the gradients are the same, so there is no 'symmetry breaking' and the network will not learn.<br>
Proper initialization can help prevent issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, and it can contribute to faster and more stable convergence during training.It's often a good practice to experiment with different initialization techniques and choose the one that works best for a specific architecture and problem. <br>
Let's see some possible techniques :</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Small random numbers</em> : this idea can be okay for small network, but it is not scalable. The activation function (using tanh, even if it is not good) tends to saturate the neurons, so the gradient will be close to zero, and the weights will not be updated (1), or all the vaules go to zero so the network will not learn anything (2).</li>

<li><em>Xavier Initialization</em> : the idea is to try to keep the same variance of the input and output of the layer, so the gradient will not explode or vanish. It assumes zero centered activation functions, and it consist into divide the weights by the square root of the number of input neurons, to use the ReLU it is necessary a small adjustment, the weights are multiplied by $\sqrt{2}$ to avoid going in the 'dying ReLU'. To use this technique for convolutional layers, $D_{in} = kernelSize^2 * inputChannels$</li>

<ul>
<li><em>MSRA Initialization</em> : the 'xaiver initialization' assumed zero centered activation functions, but the ReLU is not zero centered so without any adjustment the activation would collapse to zero (no learning). The idea is to use a correction factor, that is $\sqrt{\frac{2}{D_{in}}}$, to avoid the dying ReLU.</li>

<p><font size="5"><strong>Regularization</strong></font></p>
<p>The regularization is a technique used to reduce the risk of overfitting, that occurs when the model perform very well on the training data but fails to generalize well on the test data. The idea is to add a penalty term to the loss function, to avoid the model fit the noise in the training data.</p>
<ul>
<li>L1 regularization: $ R(W) = \sum_k\sum_l |W_{k,l}|$</li>
<li>L2 regularization: $ R(W) = \sum_k\sum_l W_{k,l} ^2$ (weight decay)</li>
<li>Elastic net: L1 + L2 regularization (the only difference is the presence of a hyperparameter $\beta$ that is the weight of the L2 regularization)</li>
<li><strong>DropOut</strong> : this technique consist into choice randomly some neurons and set their output to zero (swich off some neurons), it necessary to set an hyperparameter that is the probability of dropping out a neuron (usually a common value is = 0.5). Prevent co-adaptation that refers the tendency of neurons be depend on the presence of other specific neurons to learn some specific features. <br>
Dropout is applied only at training time and not at test time (where the neurons are all active) and the output is random, so can be useful to 'average out' the randomness at test time, this can be done by multiplying the output by the probability of the neuron to be dropped out.
It is applied especially for the fully connected layers to reduce the number of parameters, but later architectures use global average pooling instead of fully connected layers + dropout.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Augmentation</strong> : this technique is used to increase the size of the training set, applying some transformation to the existing data, with the aim to increase the generalization. It is important to apply the transformation that are meaningful for the problem, for example for the images it is possible to apply rotation, translation, scaling, cropping, flipping, adding noise, changing the color, changing the contrast, changing the brightness... and so on, but without modifying the main characteristics of the image.</p>
<p><strong>Model Ensembles</strong> : combine multiple models to obtain a better result, the idea is to train different models with different initialization weights, hyperparameters... At test time, the output of the models are averaged to obtain the final result, this approach can improve the generalization and the robustness of the model (usually 2% of improvement). A possible trick to avoid training multiple models is use different <em>snapshots</em> of the same model, that means to save the model at different training time.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The learning rate definition is not trivial, how can we choose between a small or an high value? The commmon approach is to apply a 'learning rate decay', so the main operation became the defition of the decay faunction. <br>
There are different approaches :</p>
<ul>
<li>Step decay : the learning rate is reduced by a factor every few epochs (usually 30-60-90), but this approach does not work if the improvement became flat.</li>
<li>Cosine decay: useful if we want to escape peridically from local minima and explore different areas of the loss landscape.</li>
<li>Linear decay: with this approach it possible to set an high learning rate at the beginning, it helps to reduce oscillations.</li>
<li>Inverted sqrt decay : slower decrease, usually bring to better convergence</li>
</ul>
<p>How long to train ? To understand when it is necessary to stop the training, it is possible to keep track of the model snapshot that worked best on the validation set, an early stop can be useful to avoid overfitting on the training set that means poor generalization.</p>
<p>Hyper parameters optimization :</p>
<ul>
<li>Grid search : it is a brute force approach, it is possible to define a grid of values for each hyperparameter (e.g. weights and learning rate) and try all the possible combinations.</li>
<li>Random search : it is a more efficient approach, it is possible to define a range of values for each hyperparameter and try a random combination of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or follow a more advanced approach composed by many steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1 : check initial loss (e.g. log(C) for Softmax with C classes)</li>
<li>Step 2 : overfit a tiny subset of the training data (5-10 minibatches), play with the architecture and hyperparameters (no regularization). Loss not decreasing -&gt; LR too low, Loss explodes -&gt; LR too high... avoid this situation.</li>
<li>Step 3: find a good LR (e.g. 0.1,0.01,0.001,0.0001) that decrease the loss in a few epochs</li>
<li>Step 4: train the model using LR that worked in the previous (check also the weight decay) step for a few epochs (e.g. 1-5)</li>
<li>Step 5: without LR decay, train the best model for a long time (e.g. 10-20 epochs).</li>
<li>Step 6: look at learning curves and adjust hyperparameters (e.g. regularization, LR decay, batch size, optimizer, architecture, dropout, data augmentation, etc.)</li>
<li>Step 7: repeat from step 5 until good performance on the validation set.</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="5"><strong>Transfer Learning</strong></font></p>
<p>The common idea that to train a model it is necessary a lot of data, it is busted nowdays, using this technique it is possible to use a pre-trained model and adapt it to a new task.</p>
 <div  style="display: flex; align-items: top;">
 <img src="images/transfer_learning.png"  width="auto" height="300px" style="margin-right: 10px;">
 <p> If we decide to modify only the last layer of the NN, the process take the name of Transfer learning, whereas if many layers are involve in the change, it is called Fine Tuning.<br>
 The intermediate layer are taken 'frozen', that means apply a learning rate = 0 to keep the hyperparameters prevoiusly calcutated without update anything.<br> This approach is useful in many case and is the most common starting point to create new solution to different tasks, the norm and not an exception. <br> On similar task and dataset, if we have only little data, the best approach is to use a linear classifier on the top layer, instead if we have a lot of data (100-1000 sample per class), it can be convenient finetune a few layer to adapt the NN in a better way. <br> In the case of similiar task but very different dataset, if we have little data, can be a problem (advice, try to collect more data) using a linear classifier do not guarantee good result, instead if we have a lot of data, the best solution is to finetune many layer, to adapt the NN to a 'different problem'. <br> Studies has shown that pre-training + fine tuning can be better than training from scratch, especially if the dataset is small, another advantage is that the training time is very low respect to the training from scratch.  Training from scratch works very well if we have enough data and it is essential if the model has been trained for another task (i need an anomaly detection model but i've an image recognition model)</p>
</div>
<p><font size="5"><strong>AlexNet</strong></font></p>
<p>It is composed by 5 convolutional layers (after the first, the second and the fifth there is a pooling layer) and 3 fully-connected layer (at the end of the network)
on the slide, the complete analysis with the architecture and the results.</p>
<p><img src="images/alexNet.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>Formula to calculate the output size of a convolutional layer : (D - k + 2P / S) + 1 , with D dimension of the input, k dimension of the filter, P the padding size and S the stride. The same formula is used for the pooling layer, instead the third is equal to the number of filters.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Memory occupation</em> : width_output x height_output x depth_output x element_size (e.g. each element of 4 bytes, 128x128x3x4B = 196KB)</li>
<li><em>Number of parameters (weights)</em> :  channel_output x channel_input x K x K + bias (e.g. 3x96x11x11 + 96 = 34944), the bias is equal to the number of filters.</li>
<li><em>Number of operations</em> : (channel_output x height_output x weight_output) x (channels_input x K x K)</li>
</ul>
<p>We must consider that the number of parameters is equal to zero in the pooling layer, because there are no weights.</p>
<p>The general trend shows the memory occupation decrease during the training (most of the memory usage is in the early convolutional layers), as the multiplication-adds, whereas the number of parameters increase (almost all parameters are in the fully-connected layers).</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="lezione9">Lezione9</h5>
<hr>
<p><strong>VGG Net</strong></p>
<p>This network is somehow an improvement of AlexNet (VGG16 and VGG19), all conv are 3x3 with stride 1 and pad 1, the max pool are 2x2 with stride 2 and after the pool the #channels are doubled.</p>
<ul>
<li>St1 : conv-conv-pool</li>
<li>St2 : conv-conv-pool</li>
<li>St3 : conv-conv-pool</li>
<li>St4 : conv-conv-conv-[conv]-pool  ([conv] is for the VGG19)</li>
<li>St5 : conv-conv-conv-[conv]-pool  ([conv] is for the VGG19)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using 2 3x3 conv instead of 1 5x5 conv, provide the same receptive field but with less parameters and less FLOPs. The performance of the VGG is better than the AlexNet, but pay attention to the fact that VGG is much bigger than AlexNet.
Memory occupation is 25x higher than AlexNet, the number of parameters is 2.3x higher and the number of operations is 19.4x higher.</p>
<p><strong>GoogleNet</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this project was to create deeper Network with computational efficiency. The most important idea is the introduction of the 'Inception Module', the reduction of the number of parameters (only 5 milions, 12x less AlexNet) and the removal of the FC layers.<br>
The inception module is a module that use different filter size (1x1, 3x3, 5x5) and pooling, the output of the module is the concatenation of the output of the different filters, the 1x1 convolution are important to reduce the number of channels before the expensive convolution.</p>
<p><img src="images/inception_module.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>At the end of the network the FC layers are replaced by a <em>global average pooling</em> to collapse the spatial dimensions and one linear layer to produce the scores, this is useful to reduce the number of parameters because the FC layers are the most expensive in terms of number of parameters.<br>
The googleNet was proposed before the batch normalization, so the authors used a 'auxiliary classifier'(intermediate classifier to calculate the loss and help the gradient to flow) to help the training, but nowdays is not necessary anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ResNet</strong>
With batch normalization it is possible to train deeper networks, but what happens if the network is too deep? The first guess is that the high loss on validation set is due to overfitting, but it is not true, the reality was the model seems to underfit (even at training time the loss was high). <br>
A deeper model can emulate a shallower model, setting extra layers to the identity function, but the problem is that don't learn identity functions to emulate the shallower model.</p>
<p><strong>Solution -&gt; Residual Block</strong></p>
<p>Important concepts :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Residual block</em> : this new block is composed by 2 conv layers, both with 3x3 filter, but the main innovation is the introduction of the 'skip connection' that the model can choose to take or not (the skip connection is the identity function). The output of the block is the sum of the output of the 2 conv layers and the input of the block, so the only constraint is that the dimension of the input and the output must be the same. Thanks to the shortcut the gradient can flow directly to the previous layers avoiding the vanishing gradient problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>BottleNeck layer</em> : this layer use a 1x1 filter, it is useful to reduce the number of channels, help to reduce the number of parameters, memory occupation and computational cost. It is used a 1x1 kernel because is less computational expensive than a 3x3 or 5x5 kernel (faster computation) and same result (apply non-linearity), element-wise multiplication/summation allow to learn complex pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Expansion layer</em> : this layer use a 1x1 filter and his goal is to increase the number of channels, it is used to capture and compute more complex patterns, increasing the network capacity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/residual_block.png"  width="auto" height="250px">
<p>The <em>resnet</em> has different versions, the difference is the depth of the network (e.g. resnet50, resnet18...), but the common characteristic is the division of the network in Stages, each stage is composed by a number of residual blocks. <br>
This new architecture is more efficient, provide good results (top-1 accuracy : from around 65% for resnet18 to around 75% for resnet152) with a low number of operations (similar to AlexNet) and a low number of parameters.</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="lezione10">Lezione10</h5>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Neural architecture search : the idea is to use a NN to find the best architecture to create a model, the main problem is the computational cost, because it is necessary to train many models to find the best one (original paper trained on 800 GPUs for 28 days). So followup work has focused on making the search process more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other CV tasks :</p>
<ul>
<li>Classification : single object, at the end of the network there is a softmax layer to produce the scores, the output is the class with the highest score.</li>
<li>Semantic segmentation : no object, just the class of each pixel</li>
<li>Object detection : multiple objects, the goal is to predict the classification of each object and bounding box (usually need higher resolution images, alexNet used 224x224, but for object detection is necessary 800x600), it necessary to have multiple output (also different type of output, e.g. class and bounding box)</li>
<li>Instance segmentation : object detection + semantic segmentation (multi-task problem)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Difference between Multi-task Learning and Transfer Learning</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi- task learning : the idea is to train a single model to perform multiple tasks, the model is shared between the tasks, the weights are shared . Tipically tasks are related and this is good because the model can find relationship between the tasks  and improve the performance. Each task has its own loss function and th3 multitask loss is the weighted sum of the single loss functions. The formula is $W* = argmin\sum_{t}l(D_t,w_t)+\gamma ||W||<em>*^2$ where $||W||</em>*||$ is the trace norm of the parameter matrix. The main idea is that MTL biases the model to prefer representaions that other tasks also prefer.</li>
<li>Transfer learning : the idea is to train a model on a task and use it on another task, the model is not shared between the tasks, the weights are not shared. For the second task it is used the model trained on the first one (the weights are kept frozen until the last layers).</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually to classify a single object is analyzed the whole image, so we'll consider different approaches to perform a multi-object classification/detection, for this second task we need a number of output equal to the number of object detected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sliding window : the idea is to slide a window on the image and classify the content of the window, but this approach is not manageable because it is necessary to slide the window on the entire image, so the computational cost is very high because the CNN computation is done for each image crop.E.g. Let's use an image of size H x W, a window of size h x w, possible x position are W-w +1 and possible y position are H-h +1, so the total number of windows is (W-w +1) x (H-h +1) and the total number of possible boxes is = H(H+1)/2 x W(W+1)/2, taking an image 800x600 (higher risolution for object detection) would means around 58M boxes to evaluate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Region proposal : the idea is to use an algorithm (Selective Search) that find the 'region of interest' in an image (more than thousand regions in few seconds on CPU).</p>
<ul>
<li>Region based CNN (<strong>R-CNN</strong>) : use a CNN to classify the region of interest, the first step is to resize the region to input size, then the region is passed to the CNN, the output is the class of the region and the bounding box. At the end compare the output with the ground truth boxes. The problem is that this approach is very slow, each box need to do 2k forward passes (k = #classes).</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/slow_RCNN.png"  width="auto" height="250px">
<ul>
<li>Fast R-CNN : the idea is to pre-process the image using the CNN and than apply the 'Selective Search' algorithm to find the regions of interest, the regions are resized and passed to another CNN that perform the classification and the bounding box regression. The model improve performance and speed, the training time decrease from 84h (Slow version)
to 9h (Fast version) and also the test time decrease from around 40s to around 1s. Most of the computation is done in the backbone network (first process), instead the 'pre-region' analysis is lightweight.<br>
E.g. using ResNet, the last stage is used as 'per-region' network, instead the rest of the network is used as backbone.</li>

        Intersection over Union (IoU) <br>
        We compare the ground truth box with the predicted one, the IoU is the ratio between the intersection and the union of the two boxes. Intersection_Area/Union_area
        <img src="images/IoU.png"  width="auto" height="250px"><br>
        IoU > 0.5 -> decent match <br>
        IoU > 0.7 -> good match <br>
        IoU > 0.9 -> almost perfect match <br>
    </div>
    <div style="flex-basis: 30%; padding-right: 5px;width :300px;">
        Overlapping Boxes: Non-Max Suppression NMS <br>
        Usually many boxes are overlapping, so it is necessary a post-process to keep only the best ones<br>
         <img src="images/NMS.png"  width="auto" height="250px"><br>
         For each ground truth box select the next highest-scoring box, keep the box with the IoU that is higher than a threshold (e.g. 0.5) and discard the others.
         If any box remain, take the one with the highest score.
         <br>
        The problem is that if objects are very close (overlapping) this approach can discard good boxes. But also the threashold is a problem to be estimated.
         </div>
    <div style="flex-basis: 30%;width :300px;">
        Mean Average Precision (mAP) <br>
        Run object detection on test images (with NMS) <br>
        For each class, calculate precision-recall curve / Average Precision (AP) 
        For each detection : <br>
         - If it matches some Ground truth box with IoU > 0.5, mark as positive and eliminate the GT<br>
         - Otherwise mark as negative<br>
         - Plot a PR curve<br>
          <img src="images/MaP.png"  width="250px" height="250px"><br>
          The average Precision = area under the curve, if AP = 1.0 hit all the GT boxes with IoU > 0.5 and there are no false positives, if the AP < 1.0 there are some false positives or some GT boxes are not detected. <br>
          The standard sintax is : mAP@0.60 = 0.73, that means the mAP is 0.73 if the IoU is > 0.60.

<p><strong>How to crop features (for the fast R-CNN)</strong> :
In the fast R-CNN we don't have the image anymore, but the crop is done on the feature maps, so it is necessary to identify methods to estimate to crop this features map in a proper way as done for the 'traditional images'.</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
    <div style="flex-basis: 50%; padding-right: 5px; ">
    Rol Pool  <br>
    The image pass through the CNN, so the dimensions change (more channels and less width and height), so the mapping between pixels (in the image) and 'position' in the processed image is not fixed. However, snap the box bounding to a grid cell 2x2 (1° approximation) and apply the max pool to the grid cell (2° approximation). The result is called 'region-feature' and it has always the same size, even with different input regions. The main problem of this approach is the misalignment due to snapping<br>
    <img src="images/rol_pool.png"  width="auto" height="250px"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="flex-basis: 50%; padding-right: 5px; width :500px;">
    Rol Align <br>
    This approach is more precise but also more complicated. In this case, no snapping is used, each region is calculated using a bilinear interpolation and at the end is applied the max pool to obtain the 'region-feature'. <br>
     <img src="images/rol_align.png"  width="auto" height="250px"><br>
    </div>
</div>
<p><strong>Faster R-CNN</strong></p>
<p>In the 'Fast R-CNN' the main runtime is taken by the heuristic 'selective search', so the idea was to introduce a NN to predict the proposal area, so it has been introduced the <em>Region Proposal Network</em></p>
<p><img src="images/fasterRCNN.png"  width="auto" height="250px"><br></p>
<p>The idea of the 'region proposal network' is to identify anchor box of fixed size at each point in the feature map, at each point predict whether the corresponding anchor contains an object (a score with the conv) and for the positive boxes, predict a box transformation to regress from a anchor box to object box (bounding box). At the end of this process is calculated the classification loss and the bounding-box regression loss. <br>
To avoid problem related to the shape of the anchor box, the solution is to use k different shape anchor box for each point in the feature map.<br>
This architecture is composed by two stage, the first arrive until the end of the region proposal network and the second one is the last part of the network where there is the classification and the object selection.<br>
But the second stage is necessary?</p>
<p><strong>Single stage Object detection</strong> : create the anchor and classify each one as object/not object, than classify each object anchor as one of C categories (or background), with this approach the RPN does all the work without the need of the second stage.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em> : Faster R-CNN has the best accuracy but it is slow, the single-stage version is much faster but has worse results.</p>
<h3 id="sematic-segmentation">Sematic Segmentation</h3>
<p>The goal is to classify each pixel in the image, don't care about the object, indeed if there are 2 object of the same time near each others, are not identified as different objects (the idea is that the SS merges instances).<br>
Approaches :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sliding window : the idea is to slide a window on the image and classify the content of the window, but this approach is not manageable because it is necessary to slide the window on the entire image, so the computational cost is very high. Worst approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully Convolutional: use a CNN to classify each pixel, the convolutional can change the number of channels, but the width and the height are the same; after some convolutional layers is applied an argmax to obtain the class of each pixel. There are problems with the resolution, indeed the convolution of high resolution images is very expensive.<br>
Possible solution downsampling and upsampling the image. The downsampling is done using the pooling, strided convolution... but the upsampling ?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/semanticFC.png" width="auto" height="250px"><br></p>
<p><strong>Upsampling</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Unpooling : the <em>bed of nails</em> approach transform a feature map into a sparse feature map, adding zeros between the elements, the problem is that the zeros are not informative. <br>
The <em>nearest neighbor</em> approach transform a feature map into a bigger one where each element is duplicated n-times.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/upSampling.png" width="auto" height="250px"><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Bilinear and Bicubic interpolation : the idea is to use a weighted average to expand the feature map, the bilinear interpolation is a linear interpolation on two dimensions, the bicubic interpolation is a cubic interpolation on two dimensions.</li>

<p><strong>Softmax</strong> : is often used as the last activation function of a neural network to normalize the output of a network to a probability distribution over predicted output classes. The function takes as input a vector z of K real numbers, and normalizes it into a probability distribution consisting of K probabilities proportional to the exponentials of the input numbers, indeed map the interval of values to the interval [0,1] (exponential)</p>
<p><strong>Cross Entropy loss</strong>: is a loss function used to calculate the loss between probabilities, $H(P,Q) = - \sum_{i=1}^{N} P(i) log(Q(i))$, where P is the true probability of the class/event and Q is the predicted probability of the class/event. The cross-entropy loss is a measure of how different your predicted distribution is from the true distribution of the data.</p>
<p><strong>Top-N error</strong> : is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, it is the percentage of the time that the true class is not in the top N predicted classes. For example, if the top-5 error is 0.15, that means that 15% of the time the true class is not in the top 5 predicted classes (the top-5 most probable classes do not include the true class)</p>
